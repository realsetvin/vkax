A Crypto Currency **Hard Fork** is when the code of a coin is changed in a substantial way, requiring a majority network consensus to achieve. Much like a civil war, this process can be contentious by its nature. Many active network participants must be pressed into service to signal their vote. By running a client from this branch and keeping it online, you are signaling to the network that you **Vote in Favor** of the changes proposed by this branch. A successful **Hard Fork** will be achieved if enough online clients agree.

> [!CAUTION]
> Before downloading the main client consider participating in the test net first! At this time, this branch is experimental, untested and may be unstable!

(_Notable changes include lowering the **Masternode** collateral requirement from **10 000 000** down to **1 000 000**_)

> [!NOTE]
> VKAX is an experimental crypto currency, forked from DASH (and BITCOIN) but utilizing a CPU mining algorithm called MIKE. The VKAX community can ensure the algorithm remains asic resistant through hard forks in the future.
